## 1. Hydration Problem in Next.js

### Problem Overview

In Next.js, the hydration problem occurs when a component relies on data that is only available on the client side. During server-side rendering (SSR), the server sends a fully-rendered HTML page to the client. If a component relies on client-side data or functionality, it may not work as expected during the initial render.

### Solution 1: Use `useEffect` for Client-Side Execution

To address the hydration problem, you can use the `useEffect` hook and ensure that the problematic component runs only on the client side. This way, the component will be hydrated on the client, preventing any issues during the initial server-side render.

Example:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Your client-side logic here
  }, []);

  // Rest of the component rendering
};

export default MyComponent;
```
