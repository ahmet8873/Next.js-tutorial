### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

#### Advantages:

- Faster time to first paint, enhancing the perceived performance for users.
- Better support for users with slower devices or networks due to pre-rendered content.

#### Disadvantages:

- Increased server load, as the server handles rendering for each request.
- Potentially higher initial page load time for users, especially on complex pages.
- Limited client-side interactivity, as more interactions may trigger additional server requests.

### Client-Side Rendering (SSR)

#### Advantages:

- Faster initial page load for users, as the browser renders content.
- More dynamic and interactive user experiences after the initial load.
- Simplified server load, as the client takes on rendering responsibilities.

#### Disadvantages:

- Potentially slower time to first paint, especially on slower devices or networks.
- Limited SEO optimization, as search engine crawlers may struggle with dynamic content.
- Increased client-side code complexity and potential for code duplication.
